I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in [Computational Materials Design Department](https://www.mpie.de/CM) at Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung, Germany, working with [Prof. Erik Bitzek](https://www.mpie.de/person/113848/2281). I received my doctoral degree in Mechanics from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland where I worked with [Prof William Curtin](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wcurtin) in [Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling](https://lammm.epfl.ch/). I received my Master and Bacehlor degrees in Civil Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) and [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), respectively, in 2008 and 2012. 

My research focuses on comprehending the atomistic mechanisms that govern the deformation and failure of crystalline materials. Specifically, I am intrigued by the influence of various crystal defects, such as vacancies, dislocations, cracks, and solutes, on the overall mechanical performance of materials. To investigate these complex phenomena, I primarily employ atomistic scale simulations, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC). These simulations serve as my primary tool for studying the behavior of materials at the atomic level. 

In addition to traditional simulation techniques, I have recently delved into the realm of Machine Learning (ML) tools to accelerate materials design modeling. By incorporating ML techniques into my research, I aim to enhance the efficiency of material design processes, allowing for faster and more accurate predictions of material properties. This integration of ML and atomistic simulations holds great potential for advancing the field of materials science and enabling the discovery of novel materials with desirable mechanical properties.
