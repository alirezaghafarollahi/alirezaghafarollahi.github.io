I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in [Computational Materials Design](https://www.mpie.de/CM) at Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung, Germany, working with [Prof. Erik Bitzek](https://www.mpie.de/person/113848/2281). I received my doctoral degree in Mechanics from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland where I worked with [Prof William Curtin](Now at Brown University)(https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wcurtin) in [Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling](https://lammm.epfl.ch/). I received my Master and Bacehlor degrees in Civil Engineering from Sharif University of Technology and Amirkabir University of Technology, respectively, in 2008 and 2012. 

My research interests broadly revolve around understanding the atomistic mechanisms that govern the deformation of crystalline materials. In particular, I am interested to explore how various crystal defects (vacancy, dislocations, crack, solutes etc.) impact the overal mechanical performance of materials. To this end, I mostly use atomistic scale (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo) simulations as the main tool in studying such complex phenomenon. Recently, I have started exploring the use of Machine Learning tools in accelerating the materials design modeling.
